# Useful Cloud Functions

My personal collection of useful Cloud Functions, some transformed to be used more broadly.

If you want to conrinute please feel free to make a pull request.

## Repo structure

Each folder in the root folder represents a category. Then, each folder inside has a cloud function ready to be deployed (you only need to fill in the placeholders).

## Index

1. Search
2. Zappier replacements
